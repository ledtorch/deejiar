  - BottomSheet.vue
- Details.vue
- Account.vue

### Map.vue
This component acts as the core of the application, enabling the main functionalities. It handles UI with the map, fetching stores data from a JSON file and passing this data to **BottomSheet**, which then displays the information about the selected store.

### BottomSheet.vue
A child component of **Map**, **BottomSheet** plays a role in providing users with a quick overview of store information. Dragging this component upwards leads users to a detailed page for the store, rendered by **Details**.

### Details.vue
This component fetches store data directly from a JSON file by decoding the URL. It ensures that store pages are directly accessible, maintaining functionality even when users do not navigate through clicking on the map but rather enter a URL or directly access a store's detail page.

### Account.vue
This page allows users to manage their settings and provides contact information for the author, along with links to related social media profiles.
