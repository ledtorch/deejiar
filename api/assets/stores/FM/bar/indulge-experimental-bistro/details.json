The inspiration comes from the early morning in the mountains, when the sun rises, and the sky gradually reveals a ruby-like hue between the sea of clouds and the forest. The red onion noodle dumplings represent the sea of clouds, while the chicken fat transformed into powder and tea tree mushrooms represent the mountains and forests. The spicy tomato-braised pork belly with turmeric and Buddha's hand citron pickled daikon represents the various displays of light. This also symbolizes the enticingly diverse flavors!",
